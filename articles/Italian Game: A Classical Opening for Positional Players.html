      <p>
        The Italian Game offers a variety of strategic possibilities for both White and Black. As White, the opening aims to control the center of the board and prepare for a kingside attack. One of the key ideas in the Italian Game is the maneuver known as the "Italian Bishop" or "Bishop's maneuver," where the bishop is developed to c4 or b5, targeting Black's weak f7 square.

        For Black, the Italian Game allows for flexible responses. One popular line for Black is the "Two Knights Defense," where Black counters White's central pawn push with their own pawn to e5, preparing for active piece development. Another option is the "Giuoco Pianissimo" or "Quiet Game," where Black adopts a more solid and restrained setup, focusing on solidifying their position before initiating active play.
