<h2>1. The Caro-Kann Defense: Overview</h2>
<p>The Caro-Kann Defense arises after the moves:</p>
<code>1.e4 c6</code>
<p>In this opening, Black immediately stakes a claim in the center of the board with their pawn on c6. The Caro-Kann Defense is classified under the semi-open games and falls into the broader category of closed games, where the pawn structure remains relatively closed and tactical complications are often delayed until later in the game.</p>
<p>The key idea behind the Caro-Kann Defense is to create a solid and sturdy pawn structure while preparing for counterplay in the center or on the flanks. By avoiding an early confrontation in the center, Black aims to undermine White's central control and establish a strong defensive position. The Caro-Kann Defense is known for its strategic complexity and rich middlegame possibilities.</p>
