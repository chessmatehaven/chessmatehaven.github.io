        1.e4 e6
        2.d4 d5
        3.Nc3 Bb4
      </pre>
      <p>In this line, Black willingly pins the knight on c3 with their bishop, creating an asymmetrical position with a dynamic pawn structure. The Winawer Variation is known for its tactical possibilities, imbalances, and strategic complexity.</p>
      <p>One of the key features of the Winawer Variation is the move:</p>
      <pre>
        4.e5 c5
      </pre>
      <p>White pushes their e-pawn aggressively, aiming to control the center and restrict Black's pawn breaks. Black's response, c5, challenges White's central control and opens up lines for their pieces. This move marks the beginning of intense tactical battles and intricate positional ideas.</p>
