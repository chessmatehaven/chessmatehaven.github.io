<h2>The Ragozin Defense Strategy</h2>
<p>The Ragozin Defense arises after the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.Nc3 Bb4. Black's fourth move, Bb4, pins the white knight on c3 and prepares to exchange it, putting pressure on the center.</p>
<p>One of the main strategic ideas behind the Ragozin Defense is to challenge White's central control and disrupt their pawn structure. By developing the bishop to b4, Black aims to exert pressure on the d4 pawn and potentially force exchanges that can lead to an imbalanced position.</p>
<p>Unlike other popular defenses against 1.d4, such as the Queen's Gambit Declined or the Nimzo-Indian Defense, the Ragozin Defense offers greater flexibility and avoids some of the more heavily analyzed lines. This can provide players who prefer dynamic and unbalanced positions an excellent opportunity to outplay their opponents.</p>
