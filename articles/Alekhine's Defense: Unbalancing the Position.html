        <h2>Understanding Alekhine's Defense</h2>
        <p>
          Alekhine's Defense arises after the moves:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          1.e4 Nf6
        </div>
        <p>
          Here, Black immediately challenges White's central pawn on e4 with their knight from f6. The idea is to provoke White's pawns to advance and create targets for future attacks. Although Alekhine's Defense is considered a hypermodern opening, it doesn't conform to traditional principles of pawn center control. Instead, it emphasizes piece development and plans to undermine the center later in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alekhine's Defense offers a sharp and unbalanced position right from the start. It often leads to complex middlegame positions where both sides need to tread carefully and calculate accurately. By choosing this opening, Black seeks to create tactical complications, exploit weaknesses in White's position, and surprise their opponents with unconventional setups.
        </p>
        <h3>Main Variations</h3>
        <p>
          Alekhine's Defense has several variations, each with its own characteristics and strategic goals. Let's explore two of the main variations:
        </p>
        <h4>1. Four Pawns Attack (1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.f4)</h4>
        <p>
          The Four Pawns Attack is a highly aggressive approach from White. After challenging Black's knight on d5 with e5, White aims to establish a strong pawn center and restrict Black's counterplay. Black often responds with moves like d6 and dxe5 to exploit the weaknesses in White's pawn structure and develop their pieces harmoniously.

        <h4>2. Exchange Variation (1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6)</h4>
        <p>
          The Exchange Variation simplifies the position by exchanging pawns in the center. This approach reduces the level of complexity and favors strategic maneuvering rather than tactical complications. Black has various ways to handle this variation, such as playing cxd6, dxe5, or even sacrificing a pawn to activate their pieces and create counterplay.
